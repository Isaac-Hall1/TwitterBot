# TwitterBot
This twitter bot utilizes Selenium along with the twitter API to create a twitter bot that scrapes [Twitch's highest viewed page](https://www.twitch.tv/directory/all?sort=VIEWER_COUNT) for the top 3 highest viewed streamers for 24 hours everyday, then at Midnight it would post the top 3 streamers based off of my own point awarding system. I keep this bot running by using an AWS instance.
